# dotfiles
Dotfile management

# Setup
To use these dotfiles, cd into this git repo.
To start using the `.vimrc` file type the following:
```
stow vim
```
This copies the `.vimrc` file into your home directory and makes a symlink back to here.

To start using the `.bash_profile` file type the following:
```
stow bash
```
This copies the `.bash_profile` file into your home directory and makes a symlink back to here.

# Usage
Now you can edit the `.bash_profile` and `.vimrc` files directly in your home directory and they
will get updated in the git repo.
Once you've made a few changes you can then send them back to github.
